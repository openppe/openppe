## Project OpenPPE

Letâ€™s use this space to organize info about solutions explored by the global maker community, highlight problems faced by our medical staff and build solutions that can help flatten the curve and reduce the burden on our healthcare system.

### Goals:


1. The number of reported cases for Covid-99 in India is 519 (as of 20:29, 24/3). These numbers are expected to rise sharply. India/SE Asia is a large mass of population with 100s of people suffering from mis-information about the epidemic. Our healthcare system might not be ready to handle a massive outbreak.

2. The response from the maker community is overwhelmingly positive but the devices/solutions are unverified and at different stages (some early stage,some medically verified and deployed). We would like to get input from medical professionals and take action accordingly.

3. This situation requires behaviour change/education based solutions as much as technology based ones. 

4. Stay slightly away from medical grade equipment, unless measures are desperate and that is the last resort. Any such hacks must be vetted by a bunch of doctors (atleast)
