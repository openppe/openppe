## Ideas (organized by domain)

1. Education/Communication

Bringing down the Whatsapp University (content in local languages: marwari, hindi, kannada, marathi)
Educating sellers about the usefulness of masks.     
Would good information/news actually spread like the fake news does? How can it be presented to make it spread. 
New ways of being and caring: Recognising that showing care is staying away. You can say no to somebody who wants to visit you. For their good.
Games: https://vax.herokuapp.com/ Great game to study spread of diseases


## Ideas here: 

Can we build a series of loudspeakers, where we can relay sound announcements /warnings to the masses, based on the location of the speaker. Using speakers v/s displays because its lower cost faster spread.

2.  Devices/Solutions

Ventilators- Not just academic hacks, how readily available components can be used to put together basic respiratory system (very helpful if the situation outbreaks). 
(Note: Current prototypes are still at an early stage.)

Masks- there’s not enough supply of N95 masks. Can we have mask designs around how to get N95 levels of purification that local hackerspaces can put together?
    Research report on how homemade cloth masks perform.

c.  Tracking bands - Can we hack something like this for cheap - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tagging , may be mobile application too can be developed to track movements of suspected cases. We can use old android phones too instead of building any hardware. 

d.   Social Distancing Awareness
Most people do not follow the  proximity advice issued by WHO, that’s not how humans are wired. We are not even aware of how often and when we come in close proximity to others. In times of an epidemic extreme behaviour change/self awareness tools are required. 

Can we build something inspired by a theremin that gives people feedback around their proximity from the one who wears that device? Simple audio feedback. 

      e.  Complete Medical Kits.
               
            Lots of designs for DIY devices like shields,masks,swabs, respirators etc are available. 
Movement is becoming an issue because of city-wise lockdowns (in India).
Hospital Entry might be restricted and staff is overburdened to keep calling whenever they require supplies.
A complete kit would make it convenient to transport and deliver supplies to hospitals
