### On-the ground feedback and updates

## 24/03:

Doctors from government hospitals are complaining of shortage of PPE Kits on twitter. (Independently verified)

Other conversational points from the call:

Reach out to national health bodies such as IMA or ICMR to get approval of new devices/solutions. Without their approval, doctors will hesitate and wont use your solution.
While equipment like ventilators will be required at a later stage, govt hospitals are in urgent need of basic PPE. 
Current supply of PPE kits are limited to people who work in isolation wards or ICUs. The medical staff who come into first contact with patients are ONLY given masks and gloves and are at SEVERE risk.
Private hospitals are running short of supplies too. There is a lot of chaos and supply of masks and sanitizers isnt enough to meet the hospitalâ€™s needs.

1. There is a lot of sale of synthetic and cotton face masks (colors- black or green) in cities like Bengaluru and Pune. These masks have otherwise been sold as anti-dust cycling masks (available in medical stores and platforms like Amazon, Alibaba). They are of no help in preventing a viral infection or even dust. However, they are still being bought for two reasons: 
             a. Non availability of N 95 masks. Only washable cloth masks are available in medical stores.
             b. Wrong information about surgical masks. The perception that surgical masks prevent the contagion is leading people to buy such masks.

2. Ventilator capacity will fall short in a covid surge.  3d printed splitter may allow one ventilator to be used for two patients- effectively 2x capacity. Being field Tested.
